# Chart Pattern Detection

## Description
Implement algorithms to identify larger technical chart patterns that form over many candles.

## Value
Chart patterns often indicate major trend reversals or continuations and are key components of technical analysis. This would enhance the strategic capabilities of the library.

## Implementation Approach
Create a `patterns/chart.rs` module with algorithms that analyze price movements over longer periods. These would likely need more sophisticated detection methods using statistical techniques or possibly machine learning approaches for pattern recognition.

## Examples
- Head and Shoulders (and inverse)
- Double Top/Bottom
- Triangle patterns (ascending, descending, symmetrical)
- Flag and Pennant patterns
- Cup and Handle
