# Trading Signal Generation

## Description
A framework for converting indicator values and patterns into actionable trading signals.

## Value
Bridges the gap between technical analysis and automated trading decisions, allowing users to define clear rules for entry and exit points.

## Implementation Approach
Create a new module `signals/mod.rs` with a trait-based system for signal generators. These would take indicators as input and output standardized signal types (Buy, Sell, Neutral) with confidence levels.
