# Money Flow Index (MFI)

## Description
A momentum indicator that incorporates both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure.

## Value
Often called "volume-weighted RSI," it helps identify overbought/oversold conditions while accounting for volume, which can indicate stronger signals than price-only indicators.

## Implementation Approach
Add to `momentum.rs` using calculation based on typical price multiplied by volume to determine positive and negative money flow over a period.
