# Divergence Detection

## Description
Tools to identify when price movement diverges from indicator movement.

## Value
Divergences often signal potential trend reversals and are considered strong technical signals, particularly with momentum oscillators.

## Implementation Approach
Create `signals/divergence.rs` with algorithms that can compare price highs/lows with corresponding indicator highs/lows to detect regular and hidden divergences.
